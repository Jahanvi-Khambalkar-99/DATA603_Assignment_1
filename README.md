## 1. What is big data ? Exlain it with example and mention its type.
#### * Big data can be refered as the complex data being generated in enormous amount exponential to the time which makes it difficult to process and store using regualar data   processing and storage tools/methods. 
#### * For Example, Data generated from the social media sites, Healthcare system, Transportation, Stock Market etc
#### * Types of Big Data
####  The three basic types of big data are
####  1. Structured Data
####  2. Semi Structured Data 
####  3. Unstructured Data
#### * Sub Types 
#### This form of data does not typically fall under the umbrella of Big Data. However, certain subtypes of data are relevant in the field of analytics. This type of        data often refers to the origin of data. They are classified as follows:- 
#### 1. Machine (operational logging) 
#### 2. Social media or event-triggered 
#### 3.Geospatial (locational) 
#### Data subtypes can fall under other access levels, such as:- 
#### 1. Open (i.e. open source) 
#### 2. Dark/lost (siloed systems such as CCTV) 
#### 3. Linked (transmitted web data through APIs and other methods)   (Narang, 2023)

## 2. Define 6 'V's of Big data ? 
#### 1. Volume : The amount or size of data produced (usually ranges from petabytes to zettabyte)
#### 2. Velocity : The speed by which data is being generated every second
#### 3. Variety : It refers to the type and format in which the data organized (Stuctured, semi structured, unstructured)
#### 4. Variability : How much and how frequent the data and its size or structure changes which can effect the data managing and storing process.
#### 5. Value : It refers to how valuable and useful the data is for analysis
#### 6. Veracity : Veracity is the quality and reliability of the data in concern. Unreliable data devalues the authenticity of Big Data, especially when the data is                      updated in real-time. Therefore, data authenticity requires regular checks at every level of collection and processing. (Narang, 2023)

## 3. Discuss the phases of Big data analysis.
#### 1. Data Acquisition and Recording
#### - Information is generated from various sources every seconds.
#### - As collected information are raw and some of them are not useful, it is important to filter out valuable information and generate right metadata to describe            what data is recorded and how it is recorded and measured. (Hassan, 2023)
#### 2. Infromation Extraction and Cleaning
#### - Capturing and extracting useful information and bifurcating them into suitable data format.
#### - Identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset, fill out missing data/values, correcting data entry errors, or                removing outliers.
#### 3. Data Integration, Aggregation, and Representation
#### - Combining data of different data form and from different data sources into a single format or dataset to avoid inconsistencies.
#### - Visualizing the data to decode the pattern and understand the data better to carry out analysis.
#### 4. Query Processing, Data Modeling, and Analysis
#### - To select a various particular sets of data for analysis
#### - To understand and manage data, by drawing a clear description of the data and its relationships.
#### - Using technologies like such as distributed computing to analyze data
#### 5. Interpretation
#### - Understand, and verify the results produced by the code.

#
## 4. What are the challenges of big data ?
#### 1. Heterogeneity and incompleteness : as the data comes from various sources and have different format, the machine learning algorithm does not understand the variety of the data moreover inconsistencies, and missing data can still exist even after cleaning which can lead to incorrect analysis and conclusions.
#### 2. Scale : As the growth of data is somewhat exponential, which leaves behind the computing tools and method making it hard to store and manipulate the data in the given timeframe.
#### 3. Timeliness : Since the large amount of data generated per second, It takes alot of time to actually clean, process and analyse the data to gain meaning full insight.
#### 4. Privacy : Big data often includes sensitive information, such as personal information, financial data, and healthcare records. Protecting the privacy and security of such data is critical and requires advanced security measures.
#### 5. Human Collaboration : Sometimes there is a need of human to label the raw data, solve confliction, uncertainty and error from crowd-sourcing systems. Human computational power is required to analyze the data and draw conclusion.
